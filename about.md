# Hey, I'm Uzay! ðŸ‘‹  

I'm a **Computer Science student at Skidmore College**, currently in my **senior year** as a **Davis-UWC Scholar**. My journey with technology started in **Japan**, where I studied at **UWC ISAK** and was immersed in a culture of innovation. Since then, Iâ€™ve been diving into **software development, AI, and system design**, always looking for new ways to build **scalable, impactful projects**.  

Iâ€™ve interned at **CsTech**, a software company focused on automation, where I built a **C++ tool** that optimized **cross-platform scalability**. Later, at **Optimum7**, a digital marketing and e-commerce agency, I worked on **full-stack development** and integrated **BigCommerce & Shopify APIs** into dynamic platforms.  

Some of my favorite projects include **AviaAssist**, an iOS app developed with **Turkish Airlines pilots** to optimize flight operations, and a **Gym Booking App** built in **Flask & SQL** to simplify reservations for my school's gym. I love working on **real-world solutions**, especially those that blend **UX design, integration into previous systems**. I am also taking an AI class, which sparked a new interest of AI solutions to problems.

This website serves as a hub for my **resume, projects, and blog**. Feel free to explore my work, and if youâ€™re working on an exciting project or have an opportunity that fits my skills, letâ€™s connect!
