Hi! My name is Oleksii Zeleniuk.


I was born in Prag (Czech Republic), grew up in Kyiv (Ukraine) and currently live in Hamburg (Germany).
I have a master degree in Computer science at <a href="http://kpi.ua/en" target="_blank">The National Technical University of Ukraine</a>.


Since 2009 I work as a software developer for <a href="/companies">various companies</a> where I was focusing on building web-based tools and systems as well as taking care about infrastructure, test automation and a little bit of frontend.


I started building software with PHP first but nowadays it's not limited to that and I enjoy projects in Node.js, Typescript, Python, Go, Kotlin etc. I'm especially happy to work with AWS services. 


Currently, I work as a Freelancer(Contractor) developer in Hamburg and strive to bring products and ideas of my Customers live faster and keep their technical stack up to date with IT trends.


On a personal note, I'm into a sport (like judo, football, jogging), traveling and exploring new music.


I do speak Ukrainian, Russian, English and German languages.
