      <h2>Impact-oriented</h2>
      <p><b>Apart from research, I actively advocate for health technologies including digital therapeutics, quantified self, medical tech. As a tech officer at <a href="http://www.uclmed.tech/" target="_blank">UCL MedTech</a> , I am responsible for mentoring participants in the recent PulseHackathon, in collaboration with the MIT hackathon team. <span class="evidence"><b>My interest in solving healthcare problem with technologies is truly aligned with my work in MedTech UCL.</b></span> During my time there, I organised seminars with industry leaders, such as startup founders and women in tech to share their experience. These experiences, concurrently done with my research work, have equipped me with multitasking skill under time constraints, and the ability to present ideas to people with different areas of expertise.</b>
