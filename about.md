I am a PhD candidate at the Political Science Department of the [University of Zurich](https://ipz.uzh.ch/en), working in the SNF research project "The Effect of Campaign Events on Electoral Outcomes; Evidence from Prediction Markets”.

My main area of research pertains to understanding the effect of campaign communications and candidates traits on citizens' political behavior. To find answers to the question how people's voting behavior is determined, I am currently involved in these **[research projects]**(https://aloport.github.io/projects).

Previously, I followed a Master in Political and Electoral Analysis at [Carlos III University-Juan March Institute of Madrid](https://ic3jm.es/en/) which I completed in 2017 where I specialized in experimental research on electoral studies and behavioral politics. My dissertation was titled: The personalization of politics in parliamentary democracies: a conjoint experiment in Spain. During the time of my master studies, I was a Research Assistant at the Department of Political Science, [Duke University](https://www.duke.edu/) collaborating in the Project “Women in Combat” (Principal Investigator: Prof. Laia Balcells).

Before that, I obtained my double major-degree in Law and Political Science from the [University of Pablo de Olavide of Seville](https://www.upo.es/portal/impe/web/portada?lang=en) in 2016, with a Bachelor thesis about local e-governance using quantitative methods.
