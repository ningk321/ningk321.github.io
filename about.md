# Hey, I'm Uzay! ðŸ‘‹  

I'm a **Computer Science student at Skidmore College**, currently in my **senior year** as a **Davis-UWC Scholar**. My journey with technology started in **Japan**, where I studied at **UWC ISAK** and was immersed in a culture of innovation. Since then, Iâ€™ve been diving into **software development, AI, and system design**, always looking for new ways to build **scalable, impactful projects**.  

Iâ€™ve interned at **CsTech**, a software company in the Defense Industry, where I built a **C++ tool** that optimized language translations. Later, at **Optimum7**, a digital marketing and e-commerce agency, I worked on **full-stack development** and integrated **BigCommerce & Shopify APIs** into dynamic platforms.  

Most of the projects I work on the side are real-world solution. I love working on programming solutions that have tangible impact, especially those that blend **UX design, integration into previous systems**. Currently, I am taking an AI class, which sparked a new interest of AI solutions to day-to-day problems.

This website serves as a hub for my **resume and projects**. Feel free to explore my work, and if youâ€™re working on an exciting project or have an opportunity that fits my skills, letâ€™s connect!
