<p>I am a computer science major originally from Saratoga Springs, NY.
I double major in Applied Math and Statistics and minor in linguistics.
I have done research in Health Informatics helping to generate co-occurrence
data and comorbidity data for diseases such as diabetes, ehlders-danlos syndrome, and asthma.
Ultimately, I would like to do more research in linguistics, statistics, ML,
and natural language processing.</p>

<p>Recently I have begun research into a project on machine translation of Medieval Latin
and Neo-Latin texts; large numbers of untranslated texts exist online. I hope to contribute
to the <a href = http://cltk.org/>CLTK</a> with an expanded corpus of Latin. Additionally,
I would be interested in contributing to the <a href = https://perseusdl.github.io/treebank_data/>PERSEUS</a> and <a href = https://proiel.github.io/>PROIEL</a> Latin Treebanks which annotate Classical Latin texts to generate dependency trees.</p>
