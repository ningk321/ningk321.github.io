<p>Graduating in 2020, I've built up a strong foundation in the fundamentals of computer science. Although controversial, I value and take pride in thinking through first principles, and reinventing the wheel. Whatever project I'm working on, I strive to become the subject-matter expert. Main interest lies in building complex computer systems.</p>

<p>Committed to self improvement, consistently achieving personal bests in terms of weight training and sprinting. Values and prioritize personal mental health, personal distressor activities include long distance running and taking a long bath with a face mask on.</p>

<p>Long term goal is to have a fulfilling career while at the same time be able to do good to society and improve the global standard of living.</p>

<p>Always interested in meeting new people from all backgrounds. Don't hesitate to shoot a email to schedule a coffee via waltonwang98@gmail.com.</p>
