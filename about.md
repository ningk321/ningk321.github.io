Hi, my name is Oleksii Zeleniuk, and welcome to my website!

Iâ€™m a Freelance (full-stack) software developer based in Hamburg. Since 2009 I work as a software developer for <a href="/references">various companies</a> in Germany, Estonia, and Ukraine.
I specialize in architecting and building web-based applications and taking care of infrastructure, test automation, and a little bit of frontend.

My current focus is on **Java(Kotlin)** development, but I also work with **Node.js(Typescript)** and **Python**.
I like developing Infrastructure-as-Code in **AWS** with a "you build it, you own it" mentality.
Whether using these or any other technologies, I am eager to apply **Agile Principles** to drive successful product development.

When I'm not coding, I enjoy participating in various sports such as football, jogging, and triathlon.
I do speak Ukrainian, English, and German languages.

I write about my latest projects on my <a href="https://alexzelenuyk.medium.com/">blog</a>, where I share insights into my work and interests.

Thank you for visiting my website, and please feel free to contact me if you have any questions or would like to discuss a potential project!
