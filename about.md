Born in 1992 in Southern Spain, I obtained my double major-degree in Law and Political Science from the [University of Pablo de Olavide of Seville](https://www.upo.es/portal/impe/web/portada?lang=en) in 2016, with a Bachelor thesis about local e-governance using quantitative methods.

Then I followed a Master in Political and Electoral Analysis at [Carlos III University-Juan March Institute of Madrid](https://ic3jm.es/en/) which I completed in 2017 where I specialized in experimental research on electoral studies and behavioral politics. My dissertation was titled: The personalization of politics in parliamentary democracies: a conjoint experiment in Spain. During the time of my master studies, I was a Research Assistant at the Department of Political Science, [Duke University](https://www.duke.edu/) collaborating in the Project “Women in Combat” (Principal Investigator: Prof. Laia Balcells).

After the MA studies, I received a scholarship to assist to the summer school in the [Centre for Experimental Social Sciences Nuffield (University of Oxford)](https://cess-nuffield.nuff.ox.ac.uk) where I learnt the latest techniques used in experimental social sciences.

Since October 2017, I am a PhD candidate at the Political Science Department of the [University of Zurich](https://ipz.uzh.ch/en), where I collaborate in the research project "The Effect of Campaign Events on Direct Democratic Choices; Evidence from Prediction Markets”.
