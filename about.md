<p>Hi, I'm Alex Rajewski, a research bioinformatician in the Applied Genomics, Computation, and Translational Core of Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles, CA. I recently finished my PhD in plant genetics at the University of California, Riverside. Originally from Topeka, KS, I obtained my bachelor's degree at Drake University in biochemistry, then worked in Germany for a year before getting my master's degree at the University of Georgia in horticulture. When not buried in botany or lines of code, I'm usually buried in an old sci-fi novel or a very very dark beer.</p>
