Thanks for dropping by!
<br><br>
I am a user experience researcher. My passion is
to understand and improve the intersection between human and technology,
I am curious to learn about individuals as a researcher.
Through designing and executing research studies, I elicit how people expect
things to work and translate the findings into actionable insights.

<br><br>
 My recent project involves studying the
 user experience of a wearable device for rehabilitation, in which part of the
 work is published at ACM SIG ASSETS'19 SRC.
 <br><br>
 Always interested to solve complex design problems through research.
 If you have a chance to check out some of my work at the Projects page, I hope you find them enjoyable. If you have any questions or comments on my work, do get in touch!
