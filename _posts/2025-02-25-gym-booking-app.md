### **A Scheduling and COVID Contact Tracking System for My School**  

During my time at **UWC ISAK Japan**, the **weightlifting room in the gym became overcrowded**, making it difficult for students to use it efficiently—especially during **COVID-19 restrictions**. To address this, I collaborated with the **Physical Education (PE) department** and developed a **Gym Booking Application** that provided **structured scheduling, occupancy tracking, and COVID contact tracing**.

The system was built using **Flask, SQL, and Python**, specifically chosen because my school’s internal system (**ISAK Matrix**) also used these technologies, ensuring smooth **integration**.

### **🌟 Key Features**
#### **📅 Smart Gym Scheduling**
- Allows students to **reserve gym slots** to prevent overcrowding.  
- Tracks **real-time availability** and **ensures fair access**.  

#### **🦠 COVID Contact Tracing Integration**
- If a student is **marked as COVID-positive**, the system flags all **potential contacts** who used the gym at the same time.  
- Highlights affected students in **admin dashboards**, allowing quick response.  

#### **📊 Admin Control Panel**
- PE staff can **monitor reservations, edit schedules, and manage COVID-tracing alerts** in real time.

### **🛠️ Tech Stack**
- **Flask**: Backend framework for handling requests and user sessions  
- **SQL**: Database system used for user authentication, scheduling, and COVID-tracing logs  
- **Python**: Core logic for managing reservations and alerts  
- **HTML, CSS, JavaScript**: Frontend interface
