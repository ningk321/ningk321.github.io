This is the curriculum I have settled on to learn web development in 2018. I work an unusual three day a week schedule so this will take that into account.

| Sunday | Monday | Tuesday | Wednesday | Thursday | Friday | Saturday |
|---|   
| Blog posting | Dev Tools | Ruby | Ruby | Ruby | Ruby | Projects

I work overnight from Friday through Monday morning. Monday becomes a day of adjusting back to sleeping through the night rather than working. With this in mind the follow is how I've planned to schedule my routine.

## Sunday
I have found that I have a stronger grasp on concepts when I try to explain them to someone else. With this in mind I'm planning to write a blog post each Sunday covering one or more of the concepts I've spent the week learning. Sunday is the last day of my work week so it's easy to set aside time for writing.

## Monday
I understand this is a broad topic but I feel a day devoted to tools of the trade is time well spent. Some topics will include:
* Command line
* Vim
* Atom
* Git & Github
* Google Chrome dev tools

## Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, & Friday
This is the part of the week that gives me the best opportunity to focus on a learning Ruby. I have chosen Ruby for a number of reasons. It's readability and flexibility makes it easier to focus on learning Object-Oriented programming and less on syntax. While Ruby on Rails allows for quick prototyping. I've been told repeatedly that most programming concepts translate from language to language. That the important thing in the beginning is to learn how to program. Applying that knowledge to other languages as you progress.

Ruby, Sinatra, and Ruby on Rails

## Saturday

Projects

Projects are included in the courses I'll be working through during the week as well. This day is intended to allow for additional projects as well as
