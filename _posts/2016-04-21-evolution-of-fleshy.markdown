Throughout the evolution of flowering plants (angiosperms) there have been many evolutionary transitions from an ancestral dry fruit to a more derived fleshy fruit. My dissertation research examined the genetic mechanisms behind this economically and ecologically important trait in the nightshade family of plants (Solanaceae).

In nightshades, early-diverging species like tobacco or petunia generally have a dry, dehiscent, capsular fruit, while later-diverging species like tomato or pepper have an edible, fleshy berry. Along with another grad student in [Amy Litt's](https://plantbiology.ucr.edu/people/faculty/litt.html) lab at UCR, we investigated the developmental and evolutionary basis of dry vs fleshy fruits. My research specifically focused on the dry-fruited species desert tobacco (<em>Nicotiana obtusifolia</em>), but I extended the focus of this work into wild tomato (*Solanum pimpinellifolium*), *Arabidopsis thaliana*, and melon (*Cucumis melo*).
