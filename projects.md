My research agenda consists of the following projects:

Online Political Microtargeting (OPM)
---------
 My work-in-progress PhD thesis tries to disentangle the conditions in which online political microtargeting is effective for mobilizing and persuading citizens. To that end I analyze Facebook Ads as well as conduct experiments where I investigate the role of accuracy, awareness and congruence in the success of OPM.


Campaign events and prediction markets
---------

[Prof. D. Oliver Strijbis](https://www.ipz.uzh.ch/de/institut/mitarbeitende/staff/strijbis.html) and I study the effect of expectations and campaign events on the election results. For that purpose we program electoral prediction markets that serve as a tool to predict elections similarly to polls.

 Our most recent paper, for example, studies the bandwagoning effect (psychological phenomenon by which citizens support those who simply have the appearance of winning) and the so-called 'strategic coalition voting' (which involves voting for the party that ensures the preferred post-electoral coalition) in the last Catalan elections.

If you want to participate or to know more about our prediction markets, access to the projects' websites: [Predi Spain](https://aloport.github.io/predi), [Predi Latam](https://aloport.github.io/predi_latam).


Personality of political candidates
---------

[Johannes Besch](https://www.ipz.uzh.ch/de/institut/mitarbeitende/staff/besch.html) and I are interested in the role of the personality of parties/candidates and voters in elections. More concretely, we experiment to test under what conditions voters are tolerant towards party conflict and personality congruence between voters and political candidates.

LGTBQI voting behavior
---------

*Soon...*
