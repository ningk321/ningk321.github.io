<p>Born in 1992 in Southern Spain, I obtained my double major-degree in Law and Political Science from the University of Pablo de Olavide of Seville in 2016, with a Bachelor thesis about local e-governance using quantitative methods.</p>

<p>Then I followed a Master in Political and Electoral Analysis at Carlos III University-Juan March Institute of Madrid which I completed in 2017 where I specialized in experimental research on electoral studies and behavioral politics. My dissertation was titled: The personalization of politics in parliamentary democracies: a conjoint experiment in Spain. During the time of my master studies, I was a Research Assistant at the Department of Political Science, Duke University collaborating in the Project “Women in Combat” (Principal Investigator: Prof. Laia Balcells).</p>

<p>After the MA studies, I received a scholarship to assist to the summer school in the Centre for Experimental Social Sciences Nuffield (University of Oxford) where I learnt the latest techniques used in experimental social sciences.</p>

<p>Since October 2017, I am a PhD candidate at IPZ, where I collaborate in the research project "The Effect of Campaign Events on Direct Democratic Choices; Evidence from Prediction Markets”. </p>
